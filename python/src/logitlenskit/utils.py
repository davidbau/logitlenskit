    Helper to get value from saved tensor (nnsight proxy or direct tensor).

    In nnsight remote execution, saved tensors are proxy objects with a .value
    attribute. In local execution, they're direct tensors. This helper handles
    both cases transparently.

        saved: Either an nnsight proxy object or a direct tensor

    Returns:
        The underlying tensor value
